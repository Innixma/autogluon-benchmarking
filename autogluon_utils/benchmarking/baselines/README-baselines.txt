README for running autoML baselines:

All scripts for any baseline method must be run from directory containing the baselines/ folder.

To install all packages, use: 

bash baselines/install.sh

Usage of each baseline method is demonstrated (for example to run h2o, see:  baselines/h2o_base/example_h2o.py)
